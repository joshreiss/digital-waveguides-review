<h2>Simplified Karplus Strong - Delay Line with Feedback</h2>
A delay line with feedback may be considered a highly simplified case of a waveguide. 
An excitation (the source signal) is delayed by a short duration (the delay length). 
This delayed signal is attenuated by a feedback gain, and fed back into the delay along with the source signal. 
The time for the signal to be fed back depends on the length of the delay line. 
This gives the output sound a strong pitched component, which in simple cases is the inverse of the delay length.
<br>
Here, we have extended the feedback delay to allow for various different sources, including oscillators with an adjustable frequency. 
It also has a width parameter to control the duration of the excitation.

Note that this is very simplified compared to the full Karplus-Strong algorithm. For instance, there is no filter in the feedback loop, just a gain reduction. If we want filtering, that would need to also be part of the audio worklet.
<br>
This also illustrates a problem. 
The Web Audio API automatically adds one block (128 samples) delay when a delay node appears in a feedback loop.
So x seconds of delay is actually x + 128/fs, where fs is the sample rate. 
Hence for a sample rate of 48,000 samples per second, the highest frequency of a note produced 
using this algorithm is 48,000 / 128, or 375 Hz. 
This holds even when the delay is implemented with a simple audio worklet, 
since one frame of 128 samples is processed before it can be passed back to the input. 
The solution is to implement the feedback loop inside an audio worklet, as shown next.
