<h2>Negative feedback</h2>

Wind instrument waveguides, often model closed bores (such as pan flutes) with negative feedback.
So let the feedback gain be positive or negative. Notice that pitch seems lower by an octave when feedback is negative. 
This is because a number is repeated after its sign is inverted twice, effectively doubling the delay length. Negative feedback also changes the timbre, because all even harmonics cancel themselves out.
