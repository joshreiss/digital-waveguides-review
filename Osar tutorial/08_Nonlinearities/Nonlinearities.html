<h2>Nonlinearities in the feedback filter</h2>

The previous model, when filtered, produces only short notes, even with maximum feedback. But increasing the feedback above 1 would cause the system to go unstable.
We previously multiplied the signal x by the feedback value <math><mi>g</mi></math>., in other words, applying a linear function <math><mi>g</mi><mi>x</mi></math>.
However, louder sounds are more heavily absorbed by the medium in a real environment. 
One way to model this is to use a sigmoid nonlinear function such as <math><mi>tanh</mi><mfenced><mrow><mi>g</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfenced></math> that gives less feedback for 
high values. This will also allow sustained notes without instability.<br>
