<h2>Fractional delay</h2>
    Digital delay lines are made of discrete samples, but they often need to be read at arbitrary times between samples. 
    A common approach is to use polynomial interpolation, where a polynomial is found which fits several nearby samples. Second order interpolation is often sufficient for many musical purposes.
