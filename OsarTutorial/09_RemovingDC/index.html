<h2> Removing DC offset </h2>

Suppose a nonlinearity with too much slope at the origin is applied. That is, |NL'(0)|>1, assuming NL includes the feedback.
So a slight positive or negative average offset can get amplified inside the loop until the signal gets squashed. 
This can result in the output disappearing at high feedback values. To avoid this, a one-pole 30Hz high pass filter is used in the feedback loop.
