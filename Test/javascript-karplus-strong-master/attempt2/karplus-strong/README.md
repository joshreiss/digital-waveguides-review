# JavaScript Karplus-Strong

[Karplus-Strong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karplus–Strong_string_synthesis) guitar synthesizer implemented in
JavaScript using asm.js and Web Audio. (Talk about buzzwords!)

This is a reimplementation based on decompiled ActionScript from André Michelle's
[Karplus-Strong Guitar](http://lab.andre-michelle.com/karplus-strong-guitar). Full credit for the algorithm itself
goes to him.

See http://amid.fish/javascript-karplus-strong for a demo, and for an explanation of how Karplus-Strong synthesis works.

## License

For the time being, since the code was reverse engineered from André's work which went on to become a commercial product ([Audiotool](http://www.audiotool.com)), I'm leaving this without a license so that default copyright laws apply.
