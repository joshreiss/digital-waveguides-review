<h2>Simplified Karplus Strong - Delay Line with Feedback</h2>
A comb filter with feedback may be considered a highly simplified case of a waveguide. 
An excitation (the source signal) is delayed by a short duration (the delay length). 
This delayed signal is attenuated by a feedback gain, and fed back into the delay along with the source signal. 
The time for the signal to be fed back depends on the length of the delay line. 
This gives the output sound a strong pitched component, which in simple cases is the inverse of the delay length.

<br>To Do!<br>
A delay line with feedback.<br>
This model can be represented by the following difference equation, which gives the output y at sample n as a function of previous outputs and current and previous inputs x, <br>
y[n]=x[n-d]+gy[nâˆ’d]<br>
where:
<ul>
    <li>y is the output signal,
    <li>x is the input (exciter) signal
    <li>n is the current sample
    <li>d is the delay length
    <li>g is the feedback gain
</ul>
