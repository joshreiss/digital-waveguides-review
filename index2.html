<h2>Simplified Karplus Strong - Delay Line with Feedback</h2>
A comb filter with feedback may be considered a highly simplified case of a waveguide. 
An excitation (the source signal) is delayed by a short duration (the delay length). 
This delayed signal is attenuated by a feedback gain, and fed back into the delay along with the source signal. 
The time for the signal to be fed back depends on the length of the delay line. 
This gives the output sound a strong pitched component, which in simple cases is the inverse of the delay length.

<br>To Do!<br>
A delay line with feedback.<br>
This model can be represented by the following difference equation, which gives the output y at sample n as a function of previous outputs and current and previous inputs x, <br>
y[n]=x[n-d]+gy[n−d]<br>
where:
<ul>
    <li>y is the output signal,
    <li>x is the input (exciter) signal
    <li>n is the current sample
    <li>d is the delay length
    <li>g is the feedback gain
</ul>

<h2>Negative feedback</h2>

Wind instrument waveguides, often model closed bores (such as pan flutes) with negative feedback.
So let the feedback gain be positive or negative. Notice that pitch seems lower by an octave when feedback is negative. 
This is because a number is repeated after its sign is inverted twice, effectively doubling the delay length. Negative feedback also changes the timbre, because all even harmonics cancel themselves out. 


<h2>Digital Waveguide Filters</h2>
The previous model had sustained high frequencies, giving it an unrealistic timbre. 
However, a physical medium absorbs high frequencies more heavily than low ones. 
A filter is placed inside the loop to model this. 
The following model has lowpass filters both inside the loop and filtering only the excitation. 
The lowpass filters are the default filters for the Web Audio API.<br>
 
To Do!<br>
A basic waveguide model with two filters.

<h2> Nonlinearities in the feedbck filter</h2>
The previous model, when filtered, produces only short notes, even with maximum feedback. But increasing the feedback above 1 would cause the system to go unstable.
We previously multiplied the signal x by the feedback value g, in other words, applying a linear function <math><mi>g</mi><mi>x</mi></math>.
However, louder sounds are more heavily absorbed by the medium in a real environment. 
One way to model this is to use a sigmoid nonlinear function such as <math><mi>tanh</mi><mfenced><mrow><mi>g</mi><mi>x</mi></mrow></mfenced></math> that gives less feedback for 
high values. This will also allow sustained notes without instability.<br>
  To Do!<br>
A waveguide model with filters and a nonlinearity.

    
<h2>Removing DC offset</h2>
Suppose a nonlinearity with too much slope at the origin is applied. That is, |NL'(0)|>1, assuming NL includes the feedback.
So a slight positive or negative average offset can get amplified inside the loop until the signal gets squashed. 
This can result in the output disappearing at high feedback values. To avoid this, a one-pole 30Hz high pass filter is used in the feedback loop.
  
<h2> Controlling the Pitch </h2>
The first model's pitch was simply determined by the delay length. But not, the pitch can change when the inner filter's frequency changes.
Digital filters are based on delay. So by introducing a filter, we're changing the total length of the cumulative delay line. In fact, the filters we're using have a phase delay that's different for every frequency. This makes it more difficult to find an exact solution to compensate for this delay, as the filter introduces slight inharmonicity, and it affects the pitch in a way that depends on the pitch. Thankfully we don't actually need to use our brains: we can use regression instead! Just measure how the filter affects the pitch and fit an equation onto it. For simple lowpass filters, we obtain something in the form:
<math xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><mi>K</mi><mo>=</mo><mfrac><mrow><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>2</mn></msub></mrow><mrow><mi>f</mi><mo>+</mo><msub><mi>c</mi><mn>1</mn></msub><msup><mi>f</mi><mn>2</mn></msup><mo>/</mo><msub><mi>f</mi><mi>c</mi></msub></mrow></mfrac></math>

where:
<ul>
<li>K is the delay length
<li>f is the desired pitch
<li>fc is the cutoff frequency of the inner filter
<li>c1 and c2c2 are constants tied to the inner filter algorithm being used
</ul>
A waveguide model playing a melody. For the simple 1-pole filter used here, we obtain the constants c1≈0.1786c1≈0.1786 and c2≈1.011c2≈1.011

<h2> Note Transitions</h2>
The model above has staccato notes and does not implement proper note transitions. If we attempt to change the length of the delay line while a note is playing, the output does not remotely resemble a legato sound (at best, we can change it slowly and obtain a slide whistle sound). In the legato transition of a real flute, a tone hole is opened or closed, and the bore effectively has a Y-junction during the transition. 
This can be better modeled by cross-fading between two fixed-length delay lines in the loop. 
Two delay lines will generally suffice for any monophonic sequence of notes, since one of them can generate sound while the other  changes length.

A waveguide model playing controllable legato notes. Move the "note" slider to control the notes.

<h2>Basic waveguide implementations</h2>
    To do!<br>
    The top diagram above directly matches the physical model. 
    We often use the simplified form in the second diagram, obtained by changing the point at which the delay loop is sampled, then combining delays inside the loop.<br>
    More generally, the input and output points as well as the order of elements inside the delay loop can often be modified with no audible difference, 
    even if the model is not exactly equivalent. The third diagram is intended for low latency implementation.
    
<h2>Fractional delay</h2>
    Digital delay lines are made of discrete samples, but they often need to be read at arbitrary times between samples. 
    A common approach is to use polynomial interpolation, where a polynomial is found which fits several nearby samples. Second order interpolation is often sufficient for many musical purposes.
  
<h2>Animal vocalisation example</h2>
Suppose that the looped delay line provides an infinite number of harmonics of its base frequency, some having more weight than others. 
Without any filters, the weights of harmonics are based on their harmonic distance: the simplest fractions, such as the fundamental, are the heaviest. This weight determines which harmonics are more likely to resonate, with the lighter ones generally being softer or absent (this is probabilistic when the exciter is based on noise). By adding filters into the loop, we shape the spectrum of those weights. When crossfading multiple delays in the loop, we intersect the spectra of their weighted harmonics.
However, complex filtering in the loop means the final pitch of the model will be much harder to control. 
One practical solution is to play along with it, since these pitch fluctuations can be satisfyingly organic, especially when the context is not musical.<br>
This approach is used here to create animal vocalisations. There are two parallel bandpass filters in the loop, one of which has three times the frequency of the other.
To Do!<br>
What animal is this?

<h2>Flute example</h2>
The following example simulates the higher registers of a flute by means of a bandpass crossfaded with a lowpass in the loop, making the pitch harder to predict. Despite this, an attempt is made to keep the final pitch in tune with the original intended pitch. We use the same formula introduced in the above section Controlling the Pitch, with one modification: fcfc is now the sum of the frequencies of both filters.
To Do!<br>
Flute model with exaggerated higher registers.
